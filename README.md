# dsa-demon

An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 13.

> **Warning**
> This app is a work in progress. I'm building this in public. You can follow me on Twitter [@rohansen856](https://twitter.com/rohansen856).
> See the roadmap below.

## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

**This is not a starter template.**

A few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.

## Note on Performance

> I prefer **Speed over Style**. This project is built with minimal animations to ensure insanely fast load speed and a error resistant backend.

## Features

- New `/app` dir,
- Routing, Layouts, Nested Layouts and Layout Groups
- Data Fetching, Caching and Mutation
- Loading UI
- Route handlers
- Metadata files
- Server and Client Components
- API Routes and Middlewares
- Authentication using **NextAuth.js**
- ORM using **Prisma**
- Database on **PlanetScale**
- UI Components built using **Radix UI**
- Documentation and blog using **MDX** and **Contentlayer**
- Subscriptions using **Stripe**
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Validations using **Zod**
- Written in **TypeScript**

## Roadmap

- [x] ~Add MDX support for basic pages~
- [x] ~Build marketing pages~
- [x] ~Subscriptions using Stripe~
- [x] ~Responsive styles~
- [x] ~Add OG image for blog using @vercel/og~
- [x] ~Dark mode
- [x] Add notifications system
- [x] Add chat functionality

## Known Issues

A list of things not working right now:

1. ~GitHub authentication~
2. ~[Prisma: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/task/.next/server/chunks/schema.prisma'](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16117)~
3. ~[Next.js 14: Client side navigation does not update head](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42414)~
4. [Cannot use opengraph-image.tsx inside catch-all routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48162)

## Why not tRPC, Turborepo or X?

I might add this later. For now, I want to see how far we can get using Next.js only.

If you have some suggestions, feel free to create an issue.
